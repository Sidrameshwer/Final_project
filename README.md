Understood and replicated the approximate multiplier design from a research paper (https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8353383). Used MATLAB to calculate metrics such as MRED, NMED, and ER%. Employed Cadence Design Suite with a 45nm standard cell library to evaluate area, power, and delay. Integrated an approximate compressor from another paper to optimize the least significant bits, achieving reduced area and power with a tradeoff in MRED and NMED
